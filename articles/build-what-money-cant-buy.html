    <p>I’m not money motivated. I know some people are. I wear the same T-shirts I wore in high school.

        I don’t own cars or anything like that. I look at money as a tool to build things I can’t buy today.
        
        Elon Musk is building SpaceX because he can’t buy a trip to Mars. You can have all the money in the world, but you can’t buy a trip to Mars.
        
        One hundred years ago, the richest man in the world couldn’t buy an iPhone.
        
        That’s the kind of progress I care about.
        
        Science is theory. Technology is practice. It’s applied science.
        
        People pay for the value provided to them. They pay for the impact on them, not the cost to provide it.
        
        We don’t have the same level of risk tolerance. People want an extremely high level of safety, but they don’t realize we can be too conservative.
        
        Being too conservative on safety actually leads to systemic risk. Systemic risk happens when you stop taking risks and get stuck with a system that no longer improves.
        
        The pilots who sacrificed to build modern aviation were heroes. They get the same kind of social credit we extend to folks who served overseas in the military. They help all of us.</p>
